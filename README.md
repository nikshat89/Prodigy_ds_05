🚦 US Traffic Accident Analysis (2016–2023)
This project analyzes traffic accident patterns across the United States using the US_Accidents_March23.csv dataset. The focus is on identifying key insights related to accident frequency, severity, time of day, weather conditions, and geographic hotspots.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – US Accidents (Sobhan Moosavi)
File Used: US_Accidents_March23.csv
Size: ~900MB
Records: Over 3 million
Coverage: 49 U.S. States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)
🧠 Objectives
Explore trends in traffic accidents over time
Understand how weather, road conditions, and time of day impact accident severity
Visualize accident hotspots using heatmaps
Identify top states, cities, and timeframes with high accident frequency
📊 Key Features Analyzed
Severity of accidents
Time of day and day of week
State and city-wise distribution
Weather conditions (e.g. fog, rain, snow)
